# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is a dedicated service that centralizes model management and inference capabilities for the Kai system. It follows the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) standard, which provides a consistent interface for model loading, inference, and context management.

## Why We Need an MCP Server

The traditional approach of loading machine learning models for each inference request has several limitations:

1. **Performance Issues**: Loading models for each request adds significant latency
2. **Resource Inefficiency**: Multiple instances load duplicate copies of the same models
3. **Limited Scaling**: Difficult to scale model serving independently from application logic
4. **Version Management**: No centralized mechanism for model versioning or hot-swapping
5. **Agent Integration**: No standardized way for AI agents to interact with model inference

## Key Benefits

The MCP server addresses these issues and provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Models are loaded once and kept in memory
   - Reduced latency for inference requests
   - Efficient resource utilization through batching

2. **Enhanced Model Management**
   - Centralized versioning for models
   - Ability to perform A/B testing between model versions
   - Hot-swapping models without application restarts

3. **Simplified Agent Integration**
   - Standardized protocol for agent-model communication
   - Built-in support for agent feedback loops
   - Contextual information sharing between agents and models

4. **Scalability**
   - Independent scaling of model serving components
   - Better handling of high-volume inference requests
   - Load balancing across multiple model server instances

## Components That Should Use MCP

The following ML-intensive components should be moved to MCP server architecture:

1. **Firecrawl** (Already implemented)
   - Web crawling operations
   - HTML content extraction and processing

2. **Vector Search Operations**
   - Semantic similarity operations
   - Embedding model inference
   - Batch processing of search queries
   - GPU-accelerated vector operations

3. **OCR Processing**
   - Document text extraction
   - Layout analysis
   - Handwriting recognition
   - Form field identification
   - Multiple specialized OCR models

4. **Image Analysis & Material Recognition**
   - Feature extraction from images
   - Material classification
   - Property detection
   - Quality assessment
   - Vision model inference

5. **Agent LLM Inference**
   - Large language model operations
   - Token batching
   - Model version management
   - Streaming capabilities

6. **ML Training Pipeline**
   - Transfer learning operations
   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Distributed training
   - Progress tracking and reporting

## Implementation Approach

The Kai system uses a hybrid implementation approach:

### Python-based MCP Server
- Standalone FastAPI microservice
- Direct access to ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Optimized for model inference with GPU support
- Model caching and version management

### TypeScript Client SDK
- Clean TypeScript interface for the MCP server
- Type-safe API for model management and inference
- Seamless integration with existing Kai components

### Component Adapters
- Specialized adapters for each ML component
- Authentication and metrics support
- Fallback capabilities for reliability
- Batching for improved throughput

## Integration Patterns

The MCP architecture supports two distinct integration patterns:

### Same-Package Integration
When component implementation and MCP adapter are in the same package:
- Full local fallback support
- Transparent switching between MCP and local
- Consistent API regardless of implementation

### Cross-Package Integration
When component implementation and MCP adapter are in different packages:
- Uses MCP as a communication bridge
- Respects package boundaries
- No direct cross-package dependencies

## Advanced Features

The MCP implementation includes several advanced capabilities:

### Authentication and Security
- Token-based authentication
- Automatic token management and renewal
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure logging with token masking

### Performance Metrics
- Request counts, latency, and errors
- Component-specific metrics collection
- Configurable sampling rates
- Integration with monitoring systems

### Batch Processing
- Automatic batching of similar operations
- Configurable batch sizes and timing
- Improved hardware utilization
- Optimized for GPU/TPU acceleration

## Architecture Integration

The MCP Server fits into the Kai architecture as follows:

## Implementation Status

All mock implementations previously used during development have been replaced with fully functional real API calls. The MCP server now uses actual implementations for all operations, including model management, inference, and agent interaction.

## Agent Integration

The MCP server is designed with agent integration as a core capability:

1. **Direct Agent Communication**
   - Agents can directly query model capabilities
   - Agents can provide additional context for model inference
   - Models can request clarification from agents for ambiguous inputs

2. **Knowledge Enhancement**
   - Agents can augment model outputs with additional information
   - Models can provide confidence scores that agents use for decision-making
   - Joint inference between multiple models coordinated by agents

3. **Feedback Loops**
   - Agents capture user feedback for model improvement
   - Models track inference patterns for agent learning
   - Continuous improvement through shared learning
