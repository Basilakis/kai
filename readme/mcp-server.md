# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is a dedicated service that centralizes model management and inference capabilities for the Kai system. It follows the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) standard, which provides a consistent interface for model loading, inference, and context management.

## Why We Need an MCP Server

The traditional approach of loading machine learning models for each inference request has several limitations:

1. **Performance Issues**: Loading models for each request adds significant latency
2. **Resource Inefficiency**: Multiple instances load duplicate copies of the same models
3. **Limited Scaling**: Difficult to scale model serving independently from application logic
4. **Version Management**: No centralized mechanism for model versioning or hot-swapping
5. **Agent Integration**: No standardized way for AI agents to interact with model inference

## Key Benefits

The MCP server addresses these issues and provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Models are loaded once and kept in memory
   - Reduced latency for inference requests
   - Efficient resource utilization through batching

2. **Enhanced Model Management**
   - Centralized versioning for models
   - Ability to perform A/B testing between model versions
   - Hot-swapping models without application restarts

3. **Simplified Agent Integration**
   - Standardized protocol for agent-model communication
   - Built-in support for agent feedback loops
   - Contextual information sharing between agents and models

4. **Scalability**
   - Independent scaling of model serving components
   - Better handling of high-volume inference requests
   - Load balancing across multiple model server instances

## Implementation Approach

The Kai system uses a hybrid implementation approach:

### Python-based MCP Server
- Standalone FastAPI microservice
- Direct access to ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Optimized for model inference with GPU support
- Model caching and version management

### TypeScript Client SDK
- Clean TypeScript interface for the MCP server
- Type-safe API for model management and inference
- Seamless integration with existing Kai components

## Architecture Integration

The MCP Server fits into the Kai architecture as follows:

                          └──────────────────┘
```

## Agent Integration

The MCP server is designed with agent integration as a core capability:

1. **Direct Agent Communication**
   - Agents can directly query model capabilities
   - Agents can provide additional context for model inference
   - Models can request clarification from agents for ambiguous inputs

2. **Knowledge Enhancement**
   - Agents can augment model outputs with additional information
   - Models can provide confidence scores that agents use for decision-making
   - Joint inference between multiple models coordinated by agents

3. **Feedback Loops**
   - Agents capture user feedback for model improvement
   - Models track inference patterns for agent learning
   - Continuous improvement through shared learning
