# Recently Implemented Features and Deployment Updates

## New Features and Their Deployment Configurations

The KAI platform has recently been enhanced with several new features that require specific deployment configurations. This section provides details on these features and their deployment requirements.

### Property-Based Recommendation Engine

The Property-Based Recommendation Engine is integrated with the API server and provides intelligent material recommendations based on property requirements, user preferences, and project context.

#### Deployment Configuration

The recommendation engine is deployed as part of the API server with the following configuration:

- **Deployment Method**: Integrated with the API server deployment
- **Configuration**: ConfigMap mounted to the API server
- **Resource Requirements**: Included in the API server resource allocation
- **Scaling**: Scales with the API server

#### Implementation Details

The recommendation engine is implemented as a ConfigMap that is mounted to the API server:

```yaml
# ConfigMap for the recommendation engine
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: recommendation-engine-config
  labels:
    app: api-server
    component: recommendation
data:
  recommendation_engine_enabled: "true"
  recommendation_cache_size: "1000"
  recommendation_refresh_interval: "300"  # 5 minutes
  recommendation_max_concurrent_jobs: "5"
  recommendation_similarity_threshold: "0.7"
  recommendation_config.json: |
    {
      "weightFactors": {
        "propertyMatch": 0.6,
        "userPreference": 0.3,
        "projectContext": 0.1
      },

      "defaultLimit": 20,
      "enableFeedbackLoop": true,
      "minConfidenceScore": 0.65
    }
```

The API server deployment is patched to include the recommendation engine configuration:

```yaml
# Patch for the API server deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1

          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: recommendation-engine-config
              key: recommendation_engine_enabled
        # Additional environment variables...
        volumeMounts:
        - name: recommendation-config
          mountPath: /app/config/recommendation
          readOnly: true

```

### GPU Resource Management

The GPU resource management configuration has been updated to include the new Relationship-Aware Training service:

```yaml
# GPU Resource Management in coordinator-config ConfigMap

  {
    "classes": {
      "nvidia-l40s": {
        "priority": 10,
        "models": ["multimodal-pattern-recognition", "domain-specific-networks", "relationship-aware-training"]
      },
      "nvidia-h100": {
        "priority": 20,
        "models": ["gaussian-splatting", "triposr", "wonder3d", "instant3d"]
      }
    },
    "scaling": {

      "minNodes": 1,
      "maxNodes": 10,
      "scaleDownDelay": "10m"
    }
  }
```

### GitOps Integration

All the new features are integrated with the GitOps workflow using Flux CD. The deployment configurations are stored in the GitOps repository and automatically applied by Flux.

## Deployment Updates

### Updated Kustomization Structure

The Flux GitOps repository has been updated with new directories for the recently implemented features:

```
flux/
├── clusters/
│   ├── production/
│   │   ├── kai/
│   │   │   ├── analytics/           # New directory for Material Property Analytics
│   │   │   ├── api-server/          # Updated with recommendation engine config
│   │   │   ├── coordinator/         # Updated with new workflow templates
│   │   │   ├── ml-services/         # Updated with relationship-aware training
│   │   │   └── kustomization.yaml   # Updated to include new components
```

### Deployment Process

The deployment process for the new features follows the existing GitOps workflow:

1. Changes are committed to the GitOps repository
2. Flux automatically detects the changes and applies them to the cluster
3. The new services are deployed and integrated with the existing services

### Resource Requirements

The new features have specific resource requirements that should be considered when planning cluster capacity:

| Feature | CPU | Memory | GPU | Storage |
|---------|-----|--------|-----|---------|
| Property-Based Recommendation Engine | Included in API server | Included in API server | N/A | N/A |
| Material Property Analytics | 1-4 cores | 2-8 GB | N/A | 20 GB |
| Relationship-Aware Model Training | 4-8 cores | 16-32 GB | 1 NVIDIA L40S | 40 GB |

### Monitoring and Logging

All new services are configured with Prometheus metrics and structured logging:

- Prometheus metrics exposed on port 9100
- Metrics path: `/metrics`
- Log format: JSON
- Log level: Configurable via environment variables

### Health Checks

All new services include appropriate health checks:

- Liveness probe: `/health`
- Readiness probe: `/ready`
- Startup probe (where applicable): `/startup`
