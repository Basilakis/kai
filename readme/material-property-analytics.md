- **Filtering by Material Type**: Filter distributions by material type
- **Multiple Chart Types**: View distributions as bar charts or pie charts
- **Percentage Analysis**: See the percentage of materials with each property value

### Property Trend Analysis

- **Time-Based Trends**: Track how property values change over time
- **Multiple Time Units**: View trends by day, week, month, or year
- **Count Tracking**: Monitor the number of materials with specific properties over time
- **Multiple Chart Types**: View trends as line charts or area charts
- **Customizable Time Ranges**: Focus on specific time periods

### Property Correlation Analysis

- **Correlation Visualization**: See how different properties relate to each other
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Calculate the statistical correlation between properties
- **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships between numeric properties
