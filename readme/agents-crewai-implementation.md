# crewAI Integration Implementation Guide

This document provides implementation details for integrating crewAI agents into the KAI platform, along with setup instructions and next steps.

## Implementation Status

We have implemented a foundation for integrating crewAI agents into the KAI platform. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Framework**
   - Created an agents package with core types, interfaces, and configuration structures
   - Implemented agent system management with configuration and state handling
   - Integrated with Redis for agent memory persistence

2. **Frontend Components**
   - Developed UI components for agent interaction (AgentChat, panels for different agent types)
   - Created agent-specific panels (RecognitionPanel, MaterialExpertPanel, ProjectAssistantPanel)
   - Implemented a unified dashboard to access all agent capabilities

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Designed SystemAgent interface for backend agents (KnowledgeBaseAgent, AnalyticsAgent, OperationsAgent)
   - Created initial implementations of agents for different system functions
   - Added integration points with KAI's existing backend services

4. **Tools & Utilities**
   - Implemented agent tools for material search, image analysis, and vector search
   - Created a logging utility for agent operations
   - Added service connectors to interact with existing KAI systems

## Setup Instructions

To set up the crewAI integration:

1. Make the setup script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x packages/agents/scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   cd packages/agents
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. The setup script will:
   - Create necessary directories
   - Install required dependencies
   - Create placeholder files for missing agent implementations
   - Set up the logging system

4. After running the setup script, you can use the agent system in your development environment by importing the components from the agents package.

## Usage Examples

### Initializing the Agent System

```typescript
import { initializeAgentSystem } from '@kai/agents';

// Initialize the agent system
await initializeAgentSystem({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  redis: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379
  },
  defaultModel: {
    provider: 'openai',
    name: 'gpt-4',
    temperature: 0.7
  },
  logLevel: 'info'
});
```

### Using the RecognitionAssistant

```typescript
import { createRecognitionAssistant, AgentConfig } from '@kai/agents';

// Create a RecognitionAssistant agent
const config: AgentConfig = {
  verbose: true,
  llm: {
    provider: 'openai',
    name: 'gpt-4',
    temperature: 0.7
  }
};

const assistant = await createRecognitionAssistant(config);

// Use the assistant to process user input
const response = await assistant.processUserInput('Can you analyze this image of marble tiles?');
console.log(response);
```

## Next Development Steps

The foundation for crewAI integration has been established, but several steps remain to fully implement the system:

### 1. Complete Agent Implementations

- Finish the implementation of agent classes that currently have placeholder functionality
- Implement specialized behaviors for each agent type
- Add robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 2. Connect to External Services

- Integrate with OpenAI's API for agent language capabilities
- Connect to Redis for agent memory and state persistence
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for agent actions

### 3. Enhance Frontend Integration

- Add proper WebSocket communication for real-time agent interactions
- Implement agent state persistence across user sessions
- Add visual feedback for agent processing and thinking
- Improve error handling and recovery in the UI

### 4. Backend Service Integration

- Connect agents to KAI's existing services (material database, vector store, etc.)
- Implement proper data access patterns and security controls
- Optimize performance for agent operations

### 5. Testing & Validation

- Create unit tests for agent components
- Implement integration tests for the entire agent system
- Conduct user testing for agent interactions
- Stress test the system with high volumes of requests

### 6. Deployment & Scaling

- Create deployment configurations for production
- Implement auto-scaling for agent infrastructure
- Add monitoring and alerting for agent operations
- Develop a strategy for agent updates and versioning

## Known Issues

Current known issues in the implementation:

1. Missing dependencies causing TypeScript errors
   - These will be resolved after running the setup script

2. Placeholder implementations for many agent features
   - These need to be replaced with actual implementations

3. Frontend components have styling issues
   - These are related to missing @emotion/styled dependency

4. Agent tools need proper error handling
   - Currently using basic try/catch blocks
