# Adaptive Hybrid Embedding System

## Overview

The Adaptive Hybrid Embedding System provides a sophisticated approach to generating high-quality embeddings for material recognition by dynamically selecting and switching between embedding methods based on real-time quality assessment. The system continuously evaluates embedding quality and adapts its approach to optimize results without requiring human intervention.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Method Selection**: Automatically switches between feature-based, ML-based, and hybrid embedding approaches based on quality metrics
- **Quality-Based Adaptation**: Continuously evaluates embedding quality using multiple metrics and adapts in real-time
- **Material-Specific Optimization**: Learns optimal embedding methods for different material types
- **Performance Tracking**: Maintains historical performance data to inform future decisions
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Gracefully handles failures with a cascade of fallback methods
- **Self-Improving**: Continuously refines its decision-making through performance history

## Architecture

The system consists of three primary components:

1. **Embedding Generators**: Multiple embedding generation approaches (feature-based, ML-based, hybrid)
2. **Quality Evaluation System**: Real-time assessment of embedding quality with multiple metrics
3. **Adaptive Controller**: Decision-making logic for method selection and switching

## Quality Evaluation Metrics

The system employs multiple quality metrics to evaluate embeddings:

### Vector Coherence

Measures the internal quality of the embedding vector by analyzing its statistical properties. Higher coherence indicates a more structured, information-rich embedding.

### Discrimination Power

Evaluates how well the embedding can distinguish between different materials. A good embedding will place similar materials close together and different materials far apart in the vector space.

### Anomaly Detection

Identifies embeddings that deviate from expected patterns, detecting potential issues like near-zero vectors, uniform distributions, or extreme values.

### Clustering Alignment

Assesses how well the embedding aligns with expected clustering behavior for known material categories. Good embeddings will cluster well with other embeddings from the same material category.

## Adaptation Mechanism

The adaptation mechanism operates through the following process:

1. **Initial Method Selection**:
   - For new materials, starts with the default method (usually hybrid)
   - For previously encountered materials, uses the historically best-performing method

2. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Generates an embedding using the selected method
   - Evaluates the embedding quality using multiple metrics
   - Computes an overall quality score

3. **Adaptation Decision**:
   - If quality exceeds the threshold, uses the current embedding
   - If quality falls below the threshold, tries an alternative method

4. **Method Switching**:
   - Generates a new embedding with the recommended alternative method
   - Evaluates the quality of the new embedding
   - Compares quality scores and selects the better result

5. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Records method performance for the material
   - Updates historical statistics
   - Refines future method selection based on accumulated knowledge

## Performance Optimization

The system continuously optimizes its performance through several mechanisms:

### Material-Specific Learning

- Maintains a mapping of material IDs to their optimal embedding methods
- Tracks quality scores for each material-method combination
- Adapts method selection based on historical performance

### Statistical Tracking

- Records quality metrics and processing times
- Computes exponential moving averages to favor recent performance
- Maintains category-specific statistics for tailored decisions

### Automatic Fallbacks

- Gracefully handles errors in any embedding method
- Provides cascade fallbacks to ensure successful embedding generation
- Tracks fallback events to improve future decisions

## Implementation Components

The implementation consists of two main Python modules:

### 1. Embedding Quality Evaluator (`embedding_quality_evaluator.py`)

This module handles quality assessment of embeddings and provides recommendations for method selection:

- `EmbeddingQualityMetrics` class: Implements various quality evaluation metrics
- `EmbeddingQualityEvaluator` class: Evaluates embedding quality and recommends methods

### 2. Adaptive Hybrid Embeddings (`adaptive_hybrid_embeddings.py`)

This module implements the adaptive embedding generation system:

- `AdaptiveEmbeddingGenerator` class: Core class that handles adaptive method selection
- `generate_adaptive_embedding` function: Primary entry point for generating embeddings

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from adaptive_hybrid_embeddings import generate_adaptive_embedding

# Generate an embedding with adaptive method selection
result = generate_adaptive_embedding(
    image_path="path/to/image.jpg",
    material_id="example_material_123"
)

# Access the embedding vector
embedding_vector = result["vector"]

# Check which method was ultimately used
final_method = result["method"]

# Examine quality scores
quality_scores = result["quality_scores"]
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
result = generate_adaptive_embedding(
    image_path="path/to/image.jpg",
    material_id="example_material_123",
    method="feature-based",          # Initial method suggestion
    reference_path="path/to/refs",   # Reference embeddings for quality evaluation
    cache_dir="path/to/cache",       # Cache for performance tracking
    model_path="path/to/model",      # Custom model for ML-based methods
    output_dimensions=256,           # Embedding dimensionality
    quality_threshold=0.7,           # Threshold for method switching
    adaptive=True                    # Enable/disable adaptation
)
```

### Command Line Interface

The module can also be used from the command line:

```bash
python adaptive_hybrid_embeddings.py path/to/image.jpg \
  --material-id example_material_123 \
  --method hybrid \
  --reference-path path/to/refs \
  --cache-dir path/to/cache \
  --quality-threshold 0.65
```

## Reference Data

The system can optionally use reference embeddings to improve quality evaluation and method selection:

- **Per-Category References**: Collections of known-good embeddings for each material category
- **Distribution Statistics**: Statistical properties of embeddings for anomaly detection
- **Material Categorization**: Mapping of material IDs to their categories

## Performance Tracking and Analysis

The system maintains detailed performance statistics:

- **Method Usage**: Tracks how often each method is used
- **Quality Scores**: Records average quality for each method
- **Processing Times**: Monitors computational efficiency
- **Method Switches**: Counts how often methods are switched
- **Material Performance**: Maintains material-specific statistics

These statistics can be analyzed to gain insights into system performance and further optimize the embedding generation process.

## Integration with Material Recognizer

The adaptive embedding system is fully integrated with the MaterialRecognizer class, enabling quality-based method switching during material recognition:

```python
from material_recognizer import MaterialRecognizer

# Initialize material recognizer with adaptive embedding enabled
recognizer = MaterialRecognizer(
    method="hybrid",
    adaptive=True,                   # Enable adaptive embedding selection
    quality_threshold=0.7,           # Set quality threshold for method switching
    use_gpu=True
)

# Recognize material with adaptive method selection
result = recognizer.recognize(
    image_path="path/to/image.jpg", 
    material_id="example_material_123"  # Optional but enables material-specific optimization
)

# Access the recognition results
material_type = result["material_type"]
confidence = result["confidence"]
embedding = result["embedding"]

# Examine which embedding method was used
used_method = result["embedding_method"]
quality_score = result["quality_score"]
method_switches = result["method_switches"]
```

### Material Recognizer Command Line Interface

The MaterialRecognizer CLI now supports adaptive embedding features:

```bash
python material_recognizer.py path/to/image.jpg \
  --method hybrid \
  --adaptive \
  --quality-threshold 0.7 \
  --material-id example_material_123
```

### Web API Integration

When using the material recognition through the web API, the adaptive embedding features can be enabled via query parameters:

```
POST /api/recognition
{
  "image": "base64_encoded_image",
  "adaptive": true,
  "quality_threshold": 0.7,
  "material_id": "example_material_123"
}
```

## Integration with Vector Search

The adaptive embedding system seamlessly integrates with the existing vector search implementation:

```python
from adaptive_hybrid_embeddings import generate_adaptive_embedding
from vector_search import VectorSearchIndex

# Load search index
index = VectorSearchIndex("path/to/index")

# Generate adaptive embedding
result = generate_adaptive_embedding("path/to/query_image.jpg")
query_embedding = np.array(result["vector"])

# Search for similar materials
material_ids, similarities = index.search(query_embedding, k=5)
```

## Server Integration

### Configuration Options

The adaptive embedding system can be configured at the server level through environment variables or configuration files:

```json
{
  "ml": {
    "embedding": {
      "adaptive": true,
      "defaultMethod": "hybrid",
      "qualityThreshold": 0.7,
      "cacheEnabled": true,
      "cachePath": "./cache/embedding_performance",
      "fallbackOrder": ["hybrid", "ml-based", "feature-based"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

The system exposes metrics that can be monitored in real-time:

- **Method usage distribution**: Percentage of requests using each method
- **Quality score averages**: Average quality scores per method and material type
- **Adaptation events**: Frequency of method switching events
- **Processing times**: Average, min, max processing times per method

These metrics can be visualized in dashboards to track system performance and optimization opportunities.
