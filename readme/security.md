# Security Enhancements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the KAI application, particularly focusing on authentication, session management, and API key handling.

## Cryptographic Operations

We've implemented a dedicated cryptographic utilities module (`src/utils/crypto.ts`) that provides secure methods for:

- Generating secure random tokens
- Hashing passwords and tokens
- Generating and verifying TOTP secrets
- Creating and validating API keys
- Generating backup codes

All cryptographic operations use industry-standard algorithms and practices:

- SHA-256 for hashing
- PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations for password hashing
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Timing-safe comparisons for token validation

## Security Logging

We've implemented enhanced security logging (`src/utils/securityLogger.ts`) that:

- Logs all security-relevant events (authentication attempts, token usage, etc.)
- Sanitizes sensitive information before logging
- Categorizes events by type and outcome
- Includes contextual information (IP address, user agent, etc.)

This logging system helps with:

- Security auditing
- Detecting potential security incidents
- Compliance requirements
- Troubleshooting authentication issues

## HTTP Security Headers

We've added security headers to all API responses:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Helps prevent XSS attacks
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS
- `Referrer-Policy` - Controls referrer information
- `Feature-Policy` - Restricts browser features
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Controls resource loading

Additionally, we've added cache control headers to sensitive routes:

- `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate`
- `Pragma: no-cache`
- `Expires: 0`
- `Surrogate-Control: no-store`

These headers prevent caching of sensitive information by browsers and proxies.

## Two-Factor Authentication

Our two-factor authentication implementation includes:

- Support for multiple methods (TOTP, SMS, Email)
- Secure generation and storage of TOTP secrets
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Detailed security logging of all 2FA operations
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## Session Management

Our session management system includes:

- Secure generation of session tokens
- Hashed storage of tokens in the database
- Automatic session expiration
- Ability to revoke sessions
- Detailed logging of session creation and usage

## API Key Management

Our API key management system includes:

- Secure generation of API keys
- Hashed storage of keys in the database
- Scoped permissions for API keys
- Ability to revoke keys
- Detailed logging of key creation and usage

## Rate Limiting

We've implemented rate limiting on sensitive endpoints to prevent:

- Brute force attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Excessive API usage

## Best Practices

Throughout the codebase, we follow security best practices:

- Input validation on all user inputs
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Principle of least privilege for API endpoints
- Regular security audits and code reviews

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

- Implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Adding anomaly detection for authentication attempts
- Implementing IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
- Regular security penetration testing
