# System Updates Summary

## Recent Platform Enhancements

The KAI platform has been enhanced with several major new features that require deployment updates:

### 1. Notification & Webhook System
Multi-channel messaging framework supporting in-app, email, SMS, and webhook notifications.

### 2. Parameter Registry System
Hyperparameter management system for material analysis that stores, retrieves, and suggests optimal parameters based on material type.

### 3. MultiModal Pattern Recognition
Advanced ML system bridging visual patterns and textual specifications using transformer architecture with cross-modal attention.

### 4. Domain-Specific Neural Networks
Specialized neural architectures optimized for material texture analysis with custom convolutional filters and attention mechanisms.
